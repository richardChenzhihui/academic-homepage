    Hi! It's Zhihui here! ãƒ„
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently a first-year PhD student at NUS, working on making AI systems more trustworthy and helpful in healthcare. 
    I spend my days teaching machines to be honest (unlike some humans I know ðŸ˜‰), and my nights wondering if my models 
    are secretly plotting against me.

    <strong>Research Interests:</strong> Trustworthy and Agentic LLM â€¢ Multi-modality Intelligence in Healthcare
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking for research collaborations and internship opportunities! ðŸš€
